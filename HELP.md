## Maven Parent Overrides

Due to Mavenâ€™s inheritance model, unwanted elements (such as `<license>` and `<developers>`) are inherited from the parent POM.
This project includes empty overrides to avoid this.  
If you switch to a different parent and want to re-enable inheritance, remove these overrides.
